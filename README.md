# Goals 👭🦇

- People really liked Yurivania so I wanted to make a followup that was just as cute, simple, and gay as the original.
- I wanted to experiment with limited building mechanics.
- I love GB Studio and wanted to keep using it.
- I wanted to keep the scope small so it could be finished in a reasonable amount of time.
