# Yurivania 2: Josette's Quest 🧛‍♀️🏘️

Vampire girlfriend houses her community~!

The Midnight Palace's vampire quarter has become overcrowded.

Josette, vampire facilitator, planed a date with her girlfriend, Tibby, tonight.

But the expansion deadline has come and Josette needs to put her community ahead of romance.  📆🩹

Explore the Palace, interact with the monstergirls, gathering building materials, and decide how the new wing looks.  👷‍♀️🎨

Along the way, maybe find a way to make up to Tibby for the missed date...!  💞
