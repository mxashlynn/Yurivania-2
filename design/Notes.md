# YURIVANIA II

## Concept

- Josette the vampire facilitator is expanding the vampire quarter of the Midnight Palace.
- To do this, she has to oversee the construction of a new wing.
- To do that, she has to gather materials and craftspeople from the Palace and surrounding countryside.

- Gameplay and building are going to be along the lines of story mode in Mario Maker 2.
- Mechanics and setting will be inspired by Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest and Castlevania: Order of Ecclasia.
    - But with much less technical platforming and probably no combat.
